In this project, we enter into the world of food delivery using data from Zomato, a leading platform in the industry. With almost 50,000 rows and 13 columns, the dataset provides a comprehensive view of restaurants, cuisines, and user reviews. Using LangChain and OpenAI, we clean up the data to uncover insights that can benefit businesses and consumers alike.
