# GenAI: A New Learning

## Description of GenAI with its learnings

### LLM in Data Analysis:

LLMs can be utilized to analyze textual data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, or survey responses, and extract valuable information. By applying natural language processing techniques, LLMs can run sentiment analysis, identify key topics, and extract relevant keywords.


### Learn About Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of structuring text that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform


### Vector embeddings:

Vector embeddings are essential in machine learning, particularly in NLP, recommendation, and search algorithms. They represent data, including text or numerical values, as lists of numbers for ML algorithms to process. From recommendation engines to language translators, various systems rely on embeddings to transform abstract data into actionable vectors for analysis.

### Vector Database:

Vector databases store data as multi-dimensional vectors, with dimensions varying based on complexity. These vectors, generated through techniques like machine learning, allow for swift retrieval of semantically related data, enabling searches based on contextual similarity rather than exact matches. Examples include finding songs with similar melodies, articles with matching themes, and gadgets resembling specific devices.

### Vector Similarity Search:

Vector similarity search is a technique used in computer science and business intelligence to find similar items or data points based on their vector representations. In this context, a vector refers to a mathematical representation of a data point, which could represent various types of information, such as text, images, or numerical data.


### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):

RAG is a technique that combines the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with external data sources, allowing for more nuanced and accurate AI responses.
