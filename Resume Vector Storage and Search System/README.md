## Overview:
The Resume Vector Storage and Search System is a project designed to efficiently store resume data in vector form, allowing for advanced search capabilities based on education, experience, and skills. By processing PDF files, extracting and segmenting text into smaller paragraphs, and then converting them into embeddings, the system enables users to conduct precise searches. Additionally, the project incorporates vector search techniques to explore multiple resumes and identify the most relevant matches for a given query. For instance, users can search for resumes containing specific skills such as Python and MySQL using the implemented search functionality.

### PDF Processing:
Read PDF files containing resumes.
Extract text content from PDF files.
Segment text into smaller paragraphs for analysis.

### Embedding Generation:
Convert text paragraphs into vector embeddings.
Utilize techniques like Word2Vec or Doc2Vec for embedding.
Encode textual information into numerical representations for storage and retrieval efficiency.

### Search Query Implementation:
Create search queries based on education, experience, and skills.
Develop a user-friendly interface for query input.
Integrate search algorithms to efficiently locate relevant resumes.

### Vector Search Experimentation:
Explore multiple resumes using vector search techniques.
Identify resumes closely matching specified criteria.
Experiment with different similarity metrics to enhance search accuracy.

### Skill-based Search:
Search for resumes containing specific skills (e.g., Python, MySQL) using vector search.
Customize search parameters to fit varying skill requirements.
